<P>This dissertation describes the design of the overall quality framework and
processes for use in <A HREF="http://www.icl.com/facts/4manuf.html">ICL's
Ashton Manufacturing plant</A>.</P>
<P>It provides a set of generic processes to address the requirement of
achieving and maintaining high levels of delivered product quality  in a typical
high throughput / high mix computer manufacturing environment.</P>
<P>These frameworks are suitably general purpose to be applicable to any
similar &quot;world class&quot; manufacturing situation with little alteration.</P>
<P>The dissertation outlines the two elements of manufacturing quality, namely
conformance (no deviations), and removal of infant mortalities.</P>
<P>It shows how Delivered Quality Audits are a key method of assessing the true
level of conformance of products shipped to customers, and also of gauging the
customer's opinion of total perceived quality.</P>
<P>It emphasises the fact the manufacturing must now be regarded as  a &quot;knowledge-based&quot;
business, where knowledge retention is key to  the on-going success of the
operation.  This is particularly true when viewed against the &quot;fundamental
economics of manufacturing&quot;, namely the constant need to contain and reduce
overhead costs,  and which in a climate of recession almost invariably leads to 
the departure of the oldest and most experienced staff, with a consequent loss
of their accumulated knowledge and experiences.</P>
<P>The quality processes themselves are shown as interrelated, and unified
within a single overall generic framework.  The framework is considered as one
of the vehicles for obtaining &quot;Loose/Tight fit&quot;, where best practice
techniques can be prescribed and standardised across the varied product ranges,
yet still allowing &quot;customisation&quot; of the generic frameworks to
accommodate the beneficial differences of 'Plants within a Plant'</P>
<P>The key element of Quality Improvement embodied within the framework is
shown to be the generic &quot;corrective action loop&quot;, which is capable of
handling any of the varied types of problem likely to be encountered within
a manufacturing environment.  The success of this quality improvement system is
critically dependant on the involvement of operations staff and &quot;correction
at source&quot;.</P>
<P>The other key element is the recognition that quality processes and systems
have inherent limits to their effectiveness.  To be able to exceed these limits,
a &quot;breakthrough&quot; or &quot;quantum-leap&quot; change is necessary. 
While the &quot;breakthrough&quot; activities are being formulated and
undertaken to create wide-ranging beneficial change, it is important to
recognised that the &quot;control&quot; activities of management  are vital to
prevent unfavourable changes or reversion to the previous methods occurring.</P>
<P>The final key concept explored is the three dimensions of organisational
management - accountability, responsibility and authority.  The importance of
organisational design to align these elements together and match them to the
organisational unit boundaries is clear.  Ultimately, organisational structure
can have a large influence on  the operation and effectiveness of the overall
quality processes.</P>
